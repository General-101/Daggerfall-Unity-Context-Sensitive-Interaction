# Daggerfall-Unity-Context-Sensitive-Interaction
A fork of the original Context-Sensitive Interaction mod found on Nexusmods

https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/285?tab=description

I'm on Lysandus Tomb: DFU fan server and the Daggerfall forums as General_101 if you need to reach out.

# Building
1. Download Unity 2019.4.40f1 (64-bit) from Unity Hub
2. Download the latest Daggerfall Unity source files from the releases tab on their Github. At the time of writing I am using the 1.0 release.
https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/releases
3. Place the Context-Sensitive Interaction folder found in this repository and place it into the Daggerfall Unity project at the following path
daggerfall-unity-1.0.0\Assets\Game\Mods\Context-Sensitive Interaction
4. Open Unity Hub and add the Daggerfall Unity project to your project list. Open the Daggerfall project from there by double clicking it.
5. Once the Unity editor has opened up you should see a list of drop downs on the top left of your screen. One of them should be named Daggerfall Tools. Open it to reveal the mod builder option. Click on it.
6. A new window should show up on your screen with three buttons at the top. Click on the button labeled "Open existing mod" and find the file at the following path
daggerfall-unity-1.0.0\Assets\Game\Mods\Context-Sensitive Interaction\Context-Sensitive Interaction.dfmod.json
7. Check the precompiled button on the bottom of the window and then click the button labeled "build mod. If you don't see one of these buttons then resize the window.
